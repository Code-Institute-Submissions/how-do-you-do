## Inspiration 

I was inspired to create this project after conversation with my wife, when she said,
that she would like to become teacher of English online. So I thought, that it would be nice,
if she had online presence, where she could fulfill her dream.

As well as fulfilling dreams of others to learn or teach English online.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Twitter's Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Adobe Illustrator ( hero image, avatars and screenshots editing )
	

## User Experience

> #### Wireframes 

I used good old pencil and paper to wireframe design as I find it that I can make it more personal...
They can be found

>   #### Colors
I extracted colors for the website from the hero image, and created few classes to easily
apply color styles as needed. I chose these colors as they are not intrusive and are easy to look at.
And they are associated with trust, reliability, security ( blue ). Fun ( orange ). New beginnings and growth ( green ).
These are the emotions I would like my users to feel when they arrive at landing page.

```css
.white {
	color: #fdf1ed;
	}

.bg_green {
	background-color: #0fbeba;
	}

.border_green {
	border: 1px solid #0fbeba;
	}

.bg_blue {
	background-color: #0076ba;
	}

.blue {
	color: #0076ba;
	}

.border_blue {
	border: 1px solid #0076ba;
	}

.bg_orange {
	background-color: #fc8b09;
	}
```

>  #### Translations

##### Translated pages

I have translated  landing.html, login.html and student_signup.html into 2 different languages, together
with the page titles, to start with SEO.
 
 
##### Not translated
 
 I have not translated signup.html ( teacher sign up), teacher_signup_succesful.html, teacher_dashboard.html,student_dashboard.html
 as I felt that teachers would speak English already. As well as student dashboard, as students
 are learning English and it would be first opportunity to to discover meanings of the words they don't know yet.
 
## User story

> #### Potential Student 

As a potential student I would come to visit website to check pricing of the courses.
I would have option of viewing the website in other languages, by clicking on
links of the languages in the right top corner.
If I was visiting on mobile device, I would click on the flags of the county.
I would see big green button saying Start Learning Now! right under hero image,
I could scroll down little bit to read about the benefits of learning English
and then I would see button Start Learning Now! benefits section again. 
And as I would scroll down even more I would see testimonials from 
previous students under which I would have third opportunity to click on the Start Learning Now! button.

I could fill the form with my details and pay the course fee to become student.

After my payment I would be logged into my dashboard,
where I could book my first session with teacher of my choice. I could download study materials for the sessions. 
I could write notes about the session. And if I had more sessions taken and more notes written, I could
review them as well.
If I had any need for support, I could click on support button right under my profile picture and ask for the support
required. I would have to confirm every session I took as completed, to be able to book another session. 
 Once I was finished with my work there I could Logout by clicking on LOGOUT button in the top right corner
of the screen.
