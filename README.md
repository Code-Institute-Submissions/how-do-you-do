## Purpose 

I was inspired to create this project after conversation with my wife, when she said,
that she would like to become teacher of English online. So I thought, that it would be nice,
if she had online presence, where she could fulfill her dream.

As well as fulfilling dreams of others to learn or teach English online.

## Technologies

This is first of my milestone projects, and technologies to be used are :

* HTML
* CSS
* Twiter's Bootstrap
* Font Awesome

* Extra
	* Adobe Illustrator ( hero image, avatars and screenshots editing )

## User Experience

>   ### Colors
	I extracted colors for the website from the hero image, and created few classes to easily
    apply color styles as needed.
