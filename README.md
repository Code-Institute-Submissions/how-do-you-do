## Inspiration 

I was inspired to create this project after conversation with my wife, when she said,
that she would like to become teacher of English online. So I thought, that it would be nice,
if she had online presence, where she could fulfill her dream.

As well as fulfilling dreams of others to learn or teach English online.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Twitter's Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Adobe Illustrator ( hero image, avatars and screenshots editing )
	

## User Experience

> #### Wireframes 

I used pencil and paper to wireframe design ...
They can be found at 
[Wireframes](WIREFRAMES.md)

</a>

>   #### Colors

![Teacher Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelkolarcik/how-do-you-do/master/assets/screenshots/color_scheme.png)



I extracted colors for the website from the hero image, and created few classes to easily
apply color styles as needed. I chose these colors as they are not intrusive and are easy to look at.
And they are associated with trust, reliability, security ( blue ). Fun ( orange ). New beginnings and growth ( green ).
These are the emotions I would like my users to feel when they arrive at landing page.

```css
.white {
	color: #fdf1ed;
	}

.bg_green {
	background-color: #0fbeba;
	}

.border_green {
	border: 1px solid #0fbeba;
	}

.bg_blue {
	background-color: #0076ba;
	}

.blue {
	color: #0076ba;
	}

.border_blue {
	border: 1px solid #0076ba;
	}

.bg_orange {
	background-color: #fc8b09;
	}
```

>  #### Translations

##### Translated pages

As students that are looking for online school of English probably don't speak
English yet, I have translated  landing.html, login.html and student_signup.html and some of the testimonials into 2 different languages ( more to come ), together
with the page titles, so that search engines can index those pages in different languages, so that if Spanish or Chinese   ( more to come )
future student is looking for online English school in his native language, our website would come up in search results in his particular language
 as well . 
 
 
##### Not translated
 
 I have not translated signup.html ( teacher sign up), teacher_signup_succesful.html, teacher_dashboard.html,student_dashboard.html
 as I felt that teachers would speak English already. As well as student dashboard, as students
 are learning English and it would be first opportunity to to discover meanings of the words they don't know yet.

## Testing

 I recommend using one of these modern browsers : Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera.

 Internet Explorer is not displaying animation of the hero image. ( i am currently investigating this behavior )
 
 Apple Safari responds with Error:  Can't Establish a Secure Connection to the Server github.com .
 
I tested my website on 5in and 6in phones, 10in tablet 18in laptop and 22in desktop with good response from
all of the devices.

Please see step by step testing on desktop and mobile devices here :

[Testing](TESTING.md)

I deployed how-do-you-do site by going to my github repository and then clicking on setting button,
scrolling down until I reached Github Pages section and then selecting master branch as source.

As the website is deployed in Github, it allows me to test it on more devices.
And as it is versioned, it allows me to see latest updates straight away.
